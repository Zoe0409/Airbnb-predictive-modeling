# Airbnb-predictive-modeling

This competition aims at predicting prices of Airbnb rooms in New York based on a large set of features. It starts by acquiring and defining input data, data cleaning, feature engineering, and finally by model training, selection, and prediction. The research predicts house prices by combining results of several Machine Learning algorithms. I divided my whole process into four steps:

 - Assemble the data and explore it

 - Data cleansing, build what is needed
 
 - Model selection

 - Final prediction

Several R packages are used in the research. Packages cover data visualization, data manipulation, and model training and prediction.


## Description

The dataset contains listings of over 25,000 Airbnb rentals in New York City. The goal of the Airbnb Price prediction competition is to predict the price for a rental using over 90 variables on the property, host, and past reviews.

## Metric

Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
